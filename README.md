# Official Cognite Data Fusion project configuration templates

> Configure Cognite Data Fusion quickly, consistently, traceably, and repeatably
 
> [!NOTE]
> The templates and the `cdf-tk` tool are currently in **ALPHA**. The scope in alpha is on Asset
Performance Management focused on Infield (Digital Operator Rounds). The templates and tooling
will be continously improved throughout moving towards beta and general availability.


## Getting started
1. Install the Cognite Data Fusion Toolkit in your repository. It consists the `cdf-tk` tool and modular resource packages to install in your Cognite Data Fusion projects
1. Configure the included or custom modules by editing the yaml configuration files to fit your needs
1. Verify and Deploy the configuration using `cdf-tk`
1. Optionally: add your own modules
1. Optionally: set up automated deployment using GitHub Actions

## 1. Install the toolkit CLI

To install the `cdf-tk` tool, you need a working Python installation >=3.9 (recommended 3.11). It is available as a command-line tool, and the --help flag will give you available options:

```
$ pip install cognite-toolkit
$ cdf-tk --help
```


The Cognite Data Fusion Toolkit is a command-line interface that supports three different modes of operation:

1. As an **interactive command-line tool** used alongside the Cognite Data Fusion web application to retrieve and
   push configuration of the different Cognite Data Fusion services like data sets, data models, transformations,
   and more. This mode also supports configuration of new Cognite Data Fusion projects to quickly get started.
2. As tool to support the **project life-cyle by scripting and automating** configuration and management of Cognite Data
   Fusion projects where CDF configurations are kept as yaml-files that can be checked into version
   control. This mode also supports DevOps workflows with development, staging, and production projects.
3. As a **tool to deploy official Cognite project templates** to your Cognite Data Fusion project. The tool comes
   bundled with templates useful for getting started with Cognite Data Fusion, as well as for specific use cases
   delivered by Cognite or its partners. You can also create your own templates and share them.

More details about the tool can be found at
[developer.cognite.com](http://developer.cognite.com/sdks/toolkit).


## 2. Configure modules

A **module** is a bundle of Cognite Data Fusion resources that are coupled together as logical units, for example data pipelines or the configuration of an application.

There are three kinds of modules: 

* `cognite_toolkit/modules/cdf_...`: Official Cognite modules. Do not make changes here, except adding your own config.yamls. These are potentially the only files that won't be overwritten in toolkit updates.
* `cognite_toolkit/modules/local_modules/`: Customer-specific modules can be added here as you see fit
* `cognite_toolkit/modules/examples/`: Sample configuration and data that can be useful for demonstrations or as boilerplate setup  

For convenience, modules can be combined in _packages_. See [default.packages.yaml](/cognite_toolkit/default.packages.yaml) for examples.


### Select which modules to deploy

Edit the `cognite_toolkit/local.yaml` file. You can add multiple environments (Cognite Data Fusion instances) like this:

```yaml
# environment name
dev:
  project: <customer>-dev # the cdf project name
  type: dev
  deploy: # packages or modules to deploy to this environment
    - cdf_demo_infield 
    - cdf_apm_simple
```

### Configure the relevant modules for your needs

Each module follows this pattern: 

```
modules
   <module_name>
      <cdf_resource>
      <cdf_resource>
      <cdf_resource>
      default.config.yaml # do not edit this file 
      config.yaml # copy default.config.yaml to config.yaml to edit
```


> [!WARNING]
>
> `default.config.yaml` files should not be edited as they might be overwritten by toolkit updates.
> The correct way to configure a module is to make a copy of `default.config.yaml` as `config.yaml` and make changes there. These files should be added to version control.


## 3. Verify the configuration
