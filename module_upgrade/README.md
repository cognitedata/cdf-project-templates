# Migration Tests

This directory contains tests for comparing a project setup with the previous version of the packages
with the current version of the package.

## Motivation

This is used to have a machine check for breaking changes in the package. The results of this check is
used to update `cognite_toolkit/cdf_tk/templates/_migrations.yaml` with instructions on how to migrate from
the previous version of the package to the current version of the package.

## Workflow

1. Update `tests_migrations/constants.py` with the previous versions to test against.
2. Follow the instructions in Section [Setup and Running Tests](#setup-and-running-tests) to create the virtual
   environments and running the tests.
3. If the tests pass, no further action is needed.
4. If the tests fail, update `tests_migrations/migrations.py:get_migration` function with programmatic instructions on
   how to migrate from the previous version of the package to the current version of the package.
5. Then, verify that the tests are now passing.
6. Then update `cognite_toolkit/cdf_tk/templates/_migrations.yaml` with instructions on how to migrate from the
   previous version of the package to the current version of the package.

## Setup and Running Tests

**Caveat** These tests are only run with `Windows` and `PyCharm`, there might be differences in how these tests
need to be run on other platforms.

To run the tests you need to setup virtual environments for each version of the package that you want to test.
This can be done by running the `create_environments.py` file in this directory.

```bash
python tests_migrations/create_environments.py
```

This will create a virtual environment. This is done as a separate step than running the tests as it is expensive,
and should thus be an explicit step.

Then, you can run the tests by running the `tests_migrations.py` file in this directory.

```bash
pytest tests_migrations/tests_migrations.py
```

 After running this file you folder structure should look like this:

```bash
tests_migrations
 â”£ ğŸ“‚.venv_0.1.0b1 - Virtual environment for version 0.1.0b1
 â”£ ğŸ“‚.venv_0.1.0b2
 â”£ ğŸ“‚.venv_0.1.0b3
 â”£ ğŸ“‚.venv_0.1.0b4
 â”£ ğŸ“‚.venv_0.1.0b5
 â”£ ğŸ“‚.venv_0.1.0b6
 â”£ ğŸ“‚build - (created by running tests_migrations.py) Build directory for the modules
 â”£ ğŸ“‚tmp-project - (created by running tests_migrations.py) Temporary project directory
 â”£ ğŸ“œconstants - Contains which previous versions to tests against
 â”£ ğŸ“œcreate_environments.py - Creates virtual environments for each version to test against
 â”£ ğŸ“œtests_migrations.py - Runs the tests
 â”— ğŸ“œREADME.md - This file.
```

## Tests

### <code>tests_init_migrate_build_deploy</code>

This tests runs the `init`, `build`, `deploy` command in previous versions of the package and
then runs the `build`, `deploy` in the current version. All it ensures is that the commands returns exit status 0.
There is no check that the deploy command stays consistent between versions.
