## Integration vs Unit Testing

Tests are organized into two main categories, integration and unit tests.
The integration tests are dependent on the CDF, while the unit tests are not:

```bash
ğŸ“¦tests
 â”£ ğŸ“‚tests_integration - Tests depending on CDF.
 â”£ ğŸ“‚tests_unit - Tests without any external dependencies.
 â”£ ğŸ“œconstants.py - Constants used in the tests.
 â”— ğŸ“œREADME.md - This file
```
