  WARNING: This service principal/application gets its access rights from more 
than one CDF group.
           This is not recommended. The group matching the group config file is 
marked in bold above if it is present.
---------------------
RECOMMENDATION:
  You have 2 groups with source id source-id,
  which is the same source id as the gp_test group in the group config file.
  It is recommended that this admin (CI/CD) application/service principal only 
is member of one group in the identity provider.
  This group's id should be configured as the readwrite_source_id for the 
common/cdf_auth_readwrite_all module.
