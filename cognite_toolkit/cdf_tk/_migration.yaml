    fixed:
      - Handle duplicate `TransformationSchedules` when loading `Transformation` resources.
      - Print table at the end of `cdf-tk deploy` failed with `AttributeError` if a resource.
        returned empty. This is now fixed.
      - The `cdf-tk build` command no longer gives a warning about missing `sql` file for
        `TransformationSchedule`s.
