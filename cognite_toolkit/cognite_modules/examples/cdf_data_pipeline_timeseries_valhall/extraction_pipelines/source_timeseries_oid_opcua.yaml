  # OPC UA Test simulator extraction pipeline

  OPC Unified Architecture (OPC UA) is a machine-to-machine communication protocol developed by the OPC Foundation. Cognite OPC-UA Extractor is an 
  open-source program designed to copy the OPC-UA node-hierarchy to CDF, then stream data and events to time series in CDF.

  
  Extractor service installation location example: C:\Cognite\OpcUaExtractor\bin\OpcuaExtractor.exe

  
  Config file: ...\config\config.yml (only contains the credentials as it should read the configuration in this extraction pipeline)


  Extracted data are stored directly as Assets, Time series and Events in CDF  dataset

  
  More on OPC-UA extractor: see https://docs.cognite.com/cdf/integration/guides/extraction/opc_ua/



  ## Simulator

  Prosys OPC UA Simulator Server, set endpoint in the configuration file before deployment
